# Feeding Frenzy 2 Autosplitter on PC

AutoSplitter for Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown.

## Game Preparation

It is recommended to run Steam version of Feeding Frenzy 2. Other versions may not be compatible with the Autosplitter.

## Autosplitter Settings
 
Make sure you have already downloaded Livesplit.

Open the game, **then** open Livesplit. There are two ways to set the Autosplitter.

* Right-click **Edit Splits**, and type *Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown* or *Feeding Frenzy 2* in **Game Name** (must be the complete and correct), after Autosplitter is identified, click Activate.
* Download the .asl file. Right-click **Layout Editor**, click **+** on the left and select **Control** -> **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, then double click **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, click **Browse** and select the .asl file you have downloaded.

P.S. Only choose either of the two methods, otherwise the segmentation may occur twice.

## Start Time Setting

**Start Timer at:** should be set to -1.70 for both the Any% Speedrun and Individual Stage Speedrun.

## Any%

If you're trying to do an Any% Speedrun, please make sure your Livesplit have 60 splits. You can download Feeding Frenzy 2 Any% Splits [here](https://www.speedrun.com/feeding_frenzy_2_shipwreck_showdown/resources), Autosplitter will automatically segment once at the beginning of each level when it is loaded.

## Individual Stage

If you're trying to do an Individual Stage Speedrun, please check **Individual Stage Split** in **Settings** of Autosplitter and keep your Livesplit with only one split (or right-click on the Livesplit page and select **Close Splits**, but this will require you to refill the information in **Edit Splits**). You can submit the Individual Stage Speedrun from an Any% Speedrun to the Level Leaderboard.

## Reset Function

Reset function is activated by default, which means timer will reset once you return to the main menu. If you don't need the function, you can uncheck Reset in Settings of Autosplitter in Splits Editor.

## Other Information

Autosplitter is not necessary, it can be deactivated if you don't need it. You can still manually time your run with or without Livesplit (moderators will retime your run manually), but we still recommend you to use it to finish your speedrun to make it easier for moderators to check your time.
